# World_Simulation
Three projects from OOP classes. C++, Java and Python.
The C++ one is console-based, whereas Java and Python ones are GUI-based. \
In each of the projects you first need to write in the console X and Y variables to set the board size. You can also save the current game state as well as load one. \
In Java and Python you have a player character that has a black color. \
In Java the steering is done with arrow keys and in Python with WASD keys.
